# AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning coursera IBM

The Capstone project of the AI engineer professional certificate by IBM-Coursera

It consists in the training of 2 pre trained models (resnet50 and vgg16) using Keras in order to distinguish between brocken and whole concrete images

ps At the end of the notebook you will see that I reloaded the models, it was because of an issue I had with the google collab runtime I used (my fault)
